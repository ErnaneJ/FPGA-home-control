# 🕹️ Home Control
This project aims to implement an innovative residential lighting control system, standing out for the strategic application of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The proposal focuses on providing precise and efficient lighting control, offering users a personalized and adaptable experience.

The strategic use of FPGAs allows the integration of various configuration modes, providing the system with notable flexibility and adaptability. With a simple touch of a button, users have the ability to adjust light intensity, creating a personalized atmosphere for different activities and preferences. The inclusion of a night mode, activated by a selector switch, automatically softens the lighting during the night, aiming for residents' comfort and energy efficiency.

The FPGA simplifies individual control of lights in each room, allowing precise lighting adjustments in different areas of the residence. Activating lights through specific buttons or switches offers convenience, while a master switch provides centralized control to turn on or off all lights in the residence.

This digital system, based on FPGAs, combines energy efficiency, personalized automation, and user-friendly operation, aiming to create a smart and comfortable residential environment. The choice of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in this residential lighting control project offers a flexible and efficient solution.
